Heroku used to be a good platform--or at least, so I'm told. Unlike a lot of people I know, I never had the fortune of working with Heroku full-time during its prime. My knowledge of pre-Salesforce Heroku originates entirely from anecdotes, so I don't exactly have the same rose-tinted outlook on the platform that a lot of people do. But while I don't have experience with Heroku's golden age, I do have professional experience with its current state, and I'm not impressed.

The core idea of Heroku is to abstract away the complexity of deploying, maintaining, and scaling web applications. It's a solid idea, and one that Heroku has, on paper, implemented quite well. When the gears are turning, they turn well. But when they break, they break spectacularly.
