# Hi. I'm Bytewave.

Or Byte. Or Eliot. Whichever you prefer; I'm not picky.

I make things and break things... mostly break things.

I'm a junior software developer with a passion for security. I dabble in lots of projects, languages, and technologies, such as:

- Python
- TypeScript / JavaScript
- Ruby / Rails
- C#
- Rust
- C
- Java
- PHP

Most of my work can be found on [my GitHub](https://github.com/BytewaveMLP).

Thanks for stopping by! [ðŸ’š](https://byte.gay/)
